"""The production `RegexExecutor`: a pool of killable worker processes (ADR-0004, ADR-0016).

A slot is one process (`python -m jev_judge_mcp.extract.worker`) running one pattern at a time, fed
length-prefixed pickles of plain values over its stdin and stdout, never the server's stdout. Each
pattern arrives with one absolute deadline, taken before queue admission and spent across admission,
worker start, IPC, matching, and the reply — no stage resets the clock (ADR-0016). On the deadline,
or on cancellation (ADR-0011), that slot's process is killed and a fresh one is started on the next
demand; other slots keep running. Admission is bounded: a waiter count at `queue_bound` is
`Saturated` at once, and a pattern the pool cannot admit before its deadline times out unrun.

Matching uses the standard library's `re`, a backtracking matcher like V8's Irregexp: patterns that
time out in the reference also time out here. The `regex` module short-circuits some of them
(`(a+)+$` finishes at once), which would turn the reference's `invalid_pattern` into a result
(ADR-0018).
