"""The optional provider-response cache (ADR-0047): off unless `JEV_MCP_CACHE` is truthy.

An identical request — same provider, model, state, and questions — replays the recorded
`Evaluation` from a JSON file under the cache directory instead of calling the provider again, at
zero API cost. Replay is verbatim, so every tool payload built from it is byte-identical to the
first answer's; the cache never edits a response. Keep it off when decisions must stay fresh.

Entries expire after `JEV_MCP_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` and the directory holds at most
`JEV_MCP_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` entries (oldest evicted first); with the cache off, nothing reads or
writes the directory. The key serialization and the file IO run in a worker thread, so a large
state cannot stall the event loop (ADR-0047 amendment).

The key is the SHA-256 of the exact request body (`JSON.stringify` semantics, key order included),
so any difference — model slug, one character of state, a reordered question map — is a different
entry. Entries are mode 0600 inside a 0700 directory (`fsutil`): they hold the judged State. Writes
are atomic; a cache that cannot be read or written is a miss, never an error.
