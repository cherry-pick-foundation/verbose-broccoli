"""jev_score: grade a subject on a caller-supplied ordered rubric (extension tool, ADR-0048).

The score question type was already first-class in the domain (`ScoreQuestion`, `validate_score`);
jev_review fixes its own four rubrics, and this tool hands the rubric to the caller: severity,
quality, risk — any ordered scale of 2-10 levels. One call, one rubric; the answer is a
probability-weighted position on the scale plus the full per-level distribution, never an
explanation. This tool is published beside the reference's ten (divergence `score-tool-extension`);
its caps live in `limits.SCORE` and are owned by ADR-0048, not by a parity-manifest block.
